      <t>AS Path Prepending provides a tool to manipulate the BGP AS_Path attribute
      through prepending multiple entries of an AS. AS Path Prepending is used to deprioritize a
      route or alternate path. By prepending the local ASN multiple times, ASes can make 
      advertised AS paths appear artificially longer. Excessive AS Path Prepending has caused 
      routing issues in the internet. This document provides guidance,to the internet community, 
      with how best to utilize AS Path Prepending in order to avoid negatively affecting the internet. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) <xref target="RFC4271"/> specifies the AS_Path 
      attribute which enumerates the ASs that must be traversed to reach the networks listed in 
      the BGP UPDATE message.  If the UPDATE message is propagated over an external link, 
      then the local AS number is prepended to the AS_PATH attribute, and the NEXT_HOP 
      attribute is updated with an IP address of the router that should be used as a next hop to the 
      network.  If the UPDATE message is propagated over an internal link, then the AS_PATH 
      attribute and the NEXT_HOP attribute are passed unmodified. </t>
      
      <t>A common practice among operators is to prepend multiple entries of an
      AS (known as AS Path Prepending) in order to deprioritize a route or a path. This has worked
      well in practice but the practice is increasing, with both IPv4 and IPv6, and there are inherit risks
      to the global internet especially with excessive AS Path Prepending. Prepending is frequently 
      employed in an excessive manner such that it renders routes vulnerable to disruption or 
      misdirection. AS Path Prepending is discussed in Use of BGP Large Communities 
      <xref target="RFC8195"/> and this document provides additional, and specific, guidance to 
      operators on how to be a good internet citizen with the proper use of AS Path Prepending.</t>

    <section title="Problems">
      <t>Since it it so commonly used, what is the problem with the excessive use of AS Path Prepending? Here are
      a few examples:</t>
      
      
      <section title="Excessive Prepending">
 
      <t>The risk of excessive use of AS Path Prepending can be illustrated with real-world examples. Consider the 
      prefix (95.47.142.0/23) which is normally announced with an inordinate amount of prepending. A recent analysis 
      revealed that 95.47.142.0/23 is announced to the world along the following AS path:</t>
      
      <t>3255 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 
      197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158 197158</t>

      <t>In this example, the origin AS197158 appears 23 consecutive times before being passed on to a single 
      upstream (AS3255), which passes it on to the global internet, prepended-to-all. An attacker, wanting to intercept or 
      manipulate traffic to this prefix, could enlist a datacenter to allow announcements 
      of the same prefix with a fabricated AS path such as 999999 3255 197158. Here the fictional AS999999 represents 
      the shady datacenter.  This malicious route would be pretty popular due to the shortened AS path length and might 
      go unnoticed by the true origin, even if route-monitoring had been implemented. Standard BGP route monitoring 
      checks a route’s origin and upstream and both would be intact in this scenario. The length of the prepending gives 
      the attacker room to craft an AS path that would appear plausible to the casual observer, comply with origin validation 
      mechanisms, and not be detected by off-the-shelf route monitoring.</t>
           </section>
      
         <section title="Prepending during a routing leak">
      <t>In April 2010, a service provider experienced a routing leak. While analyzing the leak something peculiar was noticed. 
      When we ranked the approximately 50,000 prefixes involved in the leak based on how many ASes accepted the leaked 
      routes, most of the impact was constrained to China routes. However, two of the top five most-propagated leaked 
      routes (listed in the table below) were US routes.</t>
      <t>During the routing leak, nearly all of the ASes of the internet preferred the China leaked routes for 12.5.48.0/21 and 
      12.4.196.0/22 because, at the time, these two US prefixes were being announced to the entire internet along the following 
      excessively prepended AS path: 3257 7795 12163 12163 12163 12163 12163 12163. Virtually 
      any illegitimate route would be preferred over the legitimate route. In this case, the victim is all but ensuring their victimhood.</t>
      <t>There was only a single upstream seen in the prepending example from above, so the prepending was achieving nothing 
      except incurring risk. You would think such mistakes would be relatively rare, 
      especially now, 10 years later.  As it turns out, there is quite a lot of prepending-to-all going on right now and during leaks, it 
      doesn’t go well for those who make this mistake. While one can debate the merits of prepending to a subset of multiple transit 
      providers, it is difficult to see the utility in prepending to every provider. In this configuration, the prepending is no longer shaping 
      route propagation. It is simply incentivizing ASes to choose another origin if one were to suddenly appear whether by mistake 
      or otherwise.</t>
                 </section>
                 
            <section title="Route Competition">
      <t>So what happens when a non-prepended route competes against an excessively prepended route? Let’s consider a real-world 
      example. The route 91.149.240.0/22 is normally announced with the origin prepended three times (41952 41952 41952) to 
      three providers and prepended twice to a fourth. Beginning at 15:28:14 UTC on June 6, a new origin that was not prepended 
      appeared in the routing table for this route. As is illustrated in the graphic below, AS60781 quickly became the most popular 
      version of this route for the next week until it disappeared.</t>
      
      <t>When both AS41952 and AS60781 were in contention for being considered the origin of this prefix, the non-prepended route was 
      dominating as we would expect. In some cases, the impact of prepending isn’t as straightforward. Let’s take 66.220.224.0/19 as an 
      example. This prefix is prepended but isn’t one of the 60,000 prepended-to-all routes mentioned earlier because its prepending is 
      only visible to a little more than half of our BGP sources. In any event, this prefix is announced to the internet in two ways: it’s prepended 
      to AS6939 and not prepended to AS174:</t>
      
      <t>...6939 17356 17356 17356 17356 17356 17356 17356 17356 17356 17356 17356</t>
      <t>...174 17356</t>

      <t>From these two route options, one might reasonably infer that it is 17356’s intention to deprioritize routes to AS6939 by prepending 
      itself 10 times on routes to that upstream. It may seem to follow that the non-prepended path to AS174 would be the most popular. 
      However, the opposite is true. Despite extensive prepending, AS6939 is the more popular choice. In this case, prepending is going up 
      against the local preferences of a legion of ASes: AS6939 has an extensive peering base of thousands of ASes. These ASes opt to send 
      traffic for free through their AS6939 peering links instead of having to pay to send traffic through a transit provider (and via AS174) 
      regardless of the AS path length. AS17356 could prepend their routes to AS6939 100 times (please don’t!) and AS6939 would still be the 
      more popular provider.  Keep in mind that the average AS diameter of the internet is only around 4 hops, so prepending more than a 
      couple of times buys you nothing.</t>
        </section>

          <section title="Prepending to All">
      
      <t>Out of approximately 750,000 routes in the IPv4 global routing table, nearly 60,000 BGP routes are prepended to 95% or more 
      of hundreds of BGP sources. About 8% of the global routing table, or 1 out of every 12 BGP routes, is configured with prepends 
      to virtually the entire internet. The 60,000 routes include entities of every stripe: governments, financial institutions, even important 
      parts of internet infrastructure.</t>

      <t>Much of the worst propagation of leaked routes during big leak events have been due to routes being prepended-to-all.
           AS4671 leak of April 2014 (>320,000 prefixes) was prepended-to-all. And the AS4788 leak of June 2015 (>260,000 prefixes)
          was also prepended-to-all. Prepended-to-all prefixes are those seen as prepended by all (or nearly all) of the ASes of the internet.
          In this configuration, prepending is no longer shaping route propagation but is simply incentivizing ASes to choose another origin 
          if one were to suddenly appear whether by mistake or otherwise. The percentage of the IPv4 table that is prepended-to-all is 
          growing at 0.5% per year. The IPv6 table is growing slower at 0.2% per year. The reasons for using prepend-to-all appears 
          to be due to 1) the AS forgetting to remove the prepending for one of its transit providers when it is no longer needed and 2) the 
          AS attempting to de-prioritize traffic from transit providers over settlement-free peers and 3) there are simply a lot of errors in 
          BGP routing. Consider the prepended AS path of 181.191.170.0/24 below:</t>

        <t>52981 267429 267429 267492 267492 267429 267429 267492 267492
                         267429 267429 267492 267492 267429</t>

        <t>The prepending here involves a mix of two distinct ASNs (267429 and 267492) with the last two digits transposed.</t>      
           </section>
         
            <section title="Memory">       
      <t>Some BGP implementations have had memory corruption/fragmentation problems with long AS_PATHS.</t>
         </section>
         
               <section title="Errant announcement">  
      <t>There was an Internet-wide outage caused by a single errant routing announcement. In this incident, AS47868 
      announced its one prefix with an extremely long AS path. Someone entered their ASN instead of the prepend count
      47868 modulo 256 = 252 prepends and when a path lengths exceeded 255, routers crashed</t>
          </section>
      
    </section>
    
        <section title="Best Practices">
        <t>Many of the best practices, or lack thereof, can be illustrated from the preceeding examples. Here's a summary of the
        best current practices of using AS Path Prepending:</t>
        
              <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Network operators should ensure prepending is absolutely necessary. Many of your networks have excessive prepending</t>
            <t>Prepending more than a couple of times buys you nothing. So don't do it.</t>
            <t>Prepending-to-all is a self-inflicted and needless risk that serves little purpose. Those excessively prepending their routes 
        should consider this risk and adjust their routing configuration.</t>
            <t>It is not typical to see more than 20 ASes in a AS_PATH in the Internet today even with the use of AS_Path 
      prepend. The Internet is typically around 5 ASes deep with the largest AS_PATH being 16-20 ASNs. Some have 
      added 100 or more AS Path Prepends and operators should therefore consider limiting the maximum AS-path 
      length being accepted</t>
                         </list></t>
